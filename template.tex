\begin{abstract} [Just collecting ideas:] 
phydra is an open-source object-oriented python package for modeling marine ecosystems, based on the xarray-simlab framework, with the goal to support efficient, open and easily reproducible model development. 

The library provides pre-built model components that can be used to assemble complex marine ecosystem models. All basic processes can be adapted and modified using python to describe different and more complex ecosystems. 

By being embedded within the xarray-simlab framework, phydra benefits from compatibilities with other scientific python packages, such as dask for parallel computing, xarray and zarr for handling large datasets, and further plotting and data analysis functionalities. 

Here, we demonstrate the usage of the phydra v1 package in a simple NPZD setting and to showcase the flexibility, in a more complex size based trophic structure model. Both in slab physics.
//
The utility of the phydra package is here shown via three model implementations. Two models from literature are recreated, and the flexible nature of this package allows a combination of as a third example.

\subsection{Marine ecosystem modeling}

\subsubsection{Biogeochemical role of phytoplankton}
- ocean ecosystem, understanding important, global change (important part of climate models)

\subsubsection{From NPZD to DARWIN}

\subsection{Open science means open source}
- lots of models, in lots of (often old) programming languages, varying implementations
- all different, hidden (+very complex) codebase, not easy to adapt & modify

- but development in data science & other computer science areas, towards reproducible tools, towards shared frameworks and capabilities (like Benoît said in his blog post)
"easy to use, open source, easy to modify, toolbox"
- python Pangeo software ecosystem (jupyter, xarray, zarr)

quick intro, and set aim!

Here, we demonstrate the usage of the phydra v1 package in a simple NPZD setting and to showcase the flexibility, in a more complex size based trophic structure model. Both in slab physics.
The package can be used for any model setting, so far only slab physics are hard-coded in package.
Ultility of phydra v1 is showcased in a parameter fitting for Use Case I
Flexibility is showcased in Use Case II, where physical setting is kept the same, but multiple FTs added.
Finally, the relevance of this work and potential next steps are discussed.

The utility of the phydra package is here shown via three model implementations. Two models from literature are recreated, and the flexible nature of this package allows a combination of as a third example. 








 %% \ SECTION 2
\section{The phydra package: structure \& features}

now explain in detail what the package is \& can do, what the structure is like

\subsection{Processes}
in xarray-simlab, (almost) everything is a process

\subsubsection{Components}
\subsubsection{Flows}
\subsubsection{Forcing & Physical Environment}

\subsection{Model development workflow}
show FIGURE 1 here, package schematic.

general explanation, and then go into detail below

% Everything below here is optional, it depends on what I can actually do in the package
\subsubsection{Dimensionality}
TEXT

\subsubsection{Runtime}
TEXT

\subsubsection{Model Diagnostics}
this is a relevant section, if Benoît can help me with creating the ODE visualization & model diagnostics.

\subsubsection{Parameter fitting}
this is a relevant section, if i manage to get some decent parameter fitting results for the example 1 and 3.. either only 3 or both, is my feeling. 








 %% \ SECTION 3
\section{Example model implementations}
- jupyter notebook for each example

\subsection{Methods}
%  quickly explain overview, explain methods for all of them shortly, with schematics, and put full system of equations & parameter tables in the Appendix!

\subsubsection{Model Structure: NPZD}

\subsubsection{Model Structure: Size-structured chemostat}

\subsubsection{Model Structure: Size-structured slab}

% then move on to Results:
\subsection{Results}

\conclusions  %% \conclusions[modified heading if necessary]

- This is a first step in the direction

- package architecture should be merged with other open-source python efforts (veros-bgcm, BGC-val)

- xsimlab is a powerful framework that is actively developed further, more added compabilities

- want to make the first step, hoping that people will adopt and contribute

- clearly: should add 1D -> 3D example models in the future

\subsection{}     %% Appendix A1, A2, etc.


\noappendix       %% use this to mark the end of the appendix section. Otherwise the figures might be numbered incorrectly (e.g. 10 instead of 1).

%% Regarding figures and tables in appendices, the following two options are possible depending on your general handling of figures and tables in the manuscript environment:

%% Option 1: If you sorted all figures and tables into the sections of the text, please also sort the appendix figures and appendix tables into the respective appendix sections.
%% They will be correctly named automatically.

%% Option 2: If you put all figures after the reference list, please insert appendix tables and figures after the normal tables and figures.
%% To rename them correctly to A1, A2, etc., please add the following commands in front of them:

\appendixfigures  %% needs to be added in front of appendix figures

\appendixtables   %% needs to be added in front of appendix tables

%% Please add \clearpage between each table and/or figure. Further guidelines on figures and tables can be found below.
