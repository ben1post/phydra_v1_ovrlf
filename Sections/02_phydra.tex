\section{The phydra package: structure \& features}
% 2nd Section:
% Background, theoretical framework. Specifics here!
\begin{comment}
Andrew's comments: (THIS IS METHODS)
- describe modelling framework and details how you built everything
- now explain in detail what the package is \& can do, what the structure is like
- clarify that it is situated in complexity between custom scripts and modelling tools with graphical interfaces. It would be possible to design a graphical interface for this later on, but that is not the target audience.


"Python is a high-level programming language well suited to rapid development and prototyping, as well as being more accessible to domain scientists than low-level languages such as FORTRAN or C++." - Mobius GMD paper

- clearly state limitations (scope) of phydra 
- mention that xarray-simlab is general enough to support IBMs! But not developed here.
\end{comment}


\subsection{Xarray-simlab: object-oriented modelling framework}
- Further detail on the xarray-simlab framework used for phydra!

\subsection{phydra package}
- phydra: easy to use, open source, easy to modify, toolbox

\subsubsection{Processes}
in xarray-simlab, (almost) everything is a process.
- in the following sections, introduce the specific implementation of xarray-simlab processes within phydra, what is actually implemented in v1 and how it can be modified and used.

\subsubsection{Components}
- Components are state variables, make sure to use clear wording and explain well

\subsubsection{Flows}
- Flows are parts of differential equations, that affect one or more components, and can be influenced by forcing and the physical environment

\subsubsection{Forcing & Physical Environment}
- Forcing can affect one Flow, but can also affect many others, if they are related to the physical environment. This might require a additional fluxes groups defined in the components. 
- explain this here, and present what is included in phydra v1, and how the boilerplate (base classes) can be modified to create your own.

\subsection{Model development workflow}

\caption{The phydra package is embedded within the xarray-simlab framework. phydra contains a library of physical settings (1), components (i.e. state variables) (2), fluxes (3) and forcing variables (4), that can be combined and reused to create an xarray-simlab model instance. Xarray-simlab provides the functionality to define the model (5) from processes in the phydra library, supply parameters and create an xarray input (6), then run the model (7) and the resulting output is dynamically stored in another xarray, with fully labeled dimensions and containing all parameters.}

general explanation, and then go into detail below (see Figure \ref{phydraschematics})

% Everything below here is optional, it depends on what I can actually do in the package
\subsubsection{Dimensionality}
- Dimensionality is a very important fact of building models, and xarray-simlab provides a simple, but sometimes tricky interface for managing dimensionality, so make sure to explain it relatively well here, as well as the implementations.
- I can cite https://www.biogeosciences.net/17/609/2020/ to explain why dimensionality is an important consideration in phytoplankton models.

\subsubsection{Runtime}
- explain what the options are to run the model, depends on if a time implicit method will be added to solve, or if it will just remain with the time explicit steps of xarray-simlab

\subsubsection{Model Diagnostics}
- this is a relevant section, *if* Beno√Æt can help me with creating the ODE visualisation & model diagnostics.

\subsubsection{Parameter fitting}
- this is a relevant section, if i manage to get some decent parameter fitting results for the example 1 and 3.. either only 3 or both, is my feeling.
