make the main points again (from intro)
old school modeling can be done better
show that I am moving in a direction that other people are! Brian Rose climlab, etc.

- This is a first step in the direction

- package architecture should be merged with other open-source python efforts (veros-bgcm, BGC-val)

- xsimlab is a powerful framework that is actively developed further, more added compabilities
- same goes for GEKKO

- lends itself well to interface with legacy fortran code, can make marine 3d modeling more accessible without loosing performance or accuracy

- want to make the first step, hoping that people will adopt and contribute

- any modeler willing to use phydra will probably have to write his own processes, and this is also the intention. Object oriented structure still highly simplifies collaboration with non-modelers or people not versed in higher-level python. Higher transparency and collaboration between modelers as well, since same code base and similar 

- clearly: should add 1D -> 3D example models in the future
