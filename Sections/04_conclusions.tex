- This is a first step in the direction

- package architecture should be merged with other open-source python efforts (veros-bgcm, BGC-val)

- xsimlab is a powerful framework that is actively developed further, more added compabilities

- want to make the first step, hoping that people will adopt and contribute

- clearly: should add 1D -> 3D example models in the future
