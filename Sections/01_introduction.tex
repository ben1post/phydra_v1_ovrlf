\subsection{Marine ecosystem modeling}

\subsubsection{Biogeochemical role of phytoplankton}
- ocean ecosystem, understanding important, global change (important part of climate models)

\subsubsection{From NPZD to DARWIN}
quote Gentleman history of marine ecosystem modeling


\subsection{Open science means open source}
- lots of models, in lots of (often old) programming languages, varying implementations
- all different, hidden (+very complex) codebase, not easy to adapt \& modify

- but development in data science & other computer science areas, towards reproducible tools, towards shared frameworks and capabilities (like Beno√Æt said in his blog post)
"easy to use, open source, easy to modify, toolbox"
- python Pangeo software ecosystem (jupyter, xarray, zarr)

\subsubsection{Xarray-simlab: object-oriented modeling framework}
- Further detail on the xarray-simlab framework used for phydra!

\subsubsection{phydra package}
- phydra: easy to use, open source, easy to modify, toolbox

quick intro, and set aim!

Here, we demonstrate the usage of the phydra v1 package in a simple NPZD setting and to showcase the flexibility, in a more complex size based trophic structure model. Both in slab physics.
The package can be used for any model setting, so far only slab physics are hard-coded in package.
Ultility of phydra v1 is showcased in a parameter fitting for Use Case I
Flexibility is showcased in Use Case II, where physical setting is kept the same, but multiple FTs added.
Finally, the relevance of this work and potential next steps are discussed.

Here, we demonstrate the usage of the phydra v1 package in a simple NPZD setting and to showcase the flexibility, in a more complex size based trophic structure model. Both in slab physics.
//
The utility of the phydra package is here shown via three model implementations. Two models from literature are recreated, and the flexible nature of this package allows a combination of as a third example.
